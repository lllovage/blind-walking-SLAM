function out = kinemBound (feasKinemMap)
% Find if actuator velocities and accelerations lie inside
% pregiven bounds for OCTOPUS.
% Input: Pass the obtained feasibility Kinematic Map if ssuccessfully
% obtained.
% Output: Structure with a recapitulative of the lengths, velocities and
% accelerations in time as well as the respecitve flags and flag value
% additions for final feasibility summary.
