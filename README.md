# Blind Walking SLAM Algorithm

## Motivation 
Walking robots represent a very good solution from the perspective of mobility but require of
more elegant (and complex) controllers capable of dealing with terrain uncertainty. This thesis
thence was realised under supervision of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China) and Universita degli Studi di Genova (Italy), contributing to the research field
of mobile robots by generating a perception through interaction scheme allowing a parallel hexapod robot intended for
welding purposes on nuclear pressure vesssels with an average maximum step length of 0.25 m
to walk on even terrain and a further extension of its capabilities into a second version capable
of negotiating uneven terrain.

The robot does not have any kind of visual system attached, for which the environment has to be mapped from the robot joints (encoders) generating what is called as a blind walking SLAM algorithm, as localization is estimated simultaneously. Because of the well organized structure of the system, the scheme accomplishes with many
requirements contemporaneously and stands out for its predictiveness, adaptiveness, modularity,
parametrized nature, proof of convergence, static stability maximisation for the given terrain,
fast computation predictive scheme and robot task compliance. A test robot SJTUâ€™s Octopus
is considered, the geometric and kinematic models of the robot are given according to previous
stages of research and the general robot kinematic model is deducted. These models are used
as part of a gait generation chain computing the geometric quantities of the gait, feasibility and
boundedness checks.

## Code

The code is separated in several folders, each accomplishing an important part of the estimation scheme. 
- Functional Polygons: Low level functions dealing with 2D polygon sectioning and several capabilities like centroid and area calculation.
- Slice Trajectory: A given polynomial trajectory can be sliced inindependent slices using at least a stride parameter to allow for the general setpoints of movement of the robot to be computed.

- Polygons on path: Functions used to decide how to set the polygons alot the pat, the corners of which belong to the grounded feet of the robot.

- Gait geometric planning: General planning of the movement in which the movement among contiguos polygons is separated in several differenciated phases to be followed by the robot.
- Feasibility geometric plan: Helps to cheack for the feasibility of the plan until this step of computation.
- Gait kinematic planning: Allows for the computation of velocities needed to control the feet in a certain manner.
- Kinematic feasibility: Speed checks are performed to allow overloading the effectors.
- Open Loop Gait Planning Example: An example of the plan for even terrain.

## Installation
Given that the code is written in Matlab, this is the only requirement needed. The real time code was generated through a Simulink scheme .
